								Hi. I'm Matt Creenan, a 40-ish year-old software
								engineer based in Buffalo, NY.

								I'm married with two kids, a dog scared of his
								own shadow, and a cat that wants to be a dog.

								When I'm not working, I may be watching football
								(Go Bills) with my wife and son, or suffering
								watching the Buffalo Sabres alone.

								This website's aesthetic was an experiment in
								trying to get an AI tool to generate a design
								based on an aesthetic I love. I kept asking it

								realm of what I was looking for.
